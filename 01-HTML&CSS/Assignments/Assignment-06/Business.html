    <p>
        <b>Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) continued to enjoy its record-eclipsing streak on Thursday as the KSE-100 index
            surged past 106,000-point mark, gaining more than 1,500 points as a rally fueled by positive economic
            indicators and lower inflation rates continued.<br /><br />
        </b>

        The benchmark KSE-100 index rose by 1,533.30 points, or 1.46%, reaching 106,637.63 points, up from the previous
        close of 105,448.05 points.<br /><br />

        The rally comes after Pakistanâ€™s annual inflation rate dropped to 4.9% in November, the lowest level since 2017.<br /><br />

        The market saw significant activity, with a trading volume of 285,847,491 shares and a value of 16.21 billion
        Pakistani rupees.<br /><br />

        On Wednesday, the market gained nearly 550 points and reached a new peak, getting major support from sectors
        such as banking, energy and technology.<br /><br />

        The positive momentum reflected the strengthening economic fundamentals and expectations of continuous growth.
        Investors awaited the State Bank of Pakistan's (SBP) policy rate decision in the upcoming monetary policy
        committee meeting, scheduled for December 16.<br /><br />

        Moreover, the inflation rate, measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), decelerated to 4.9% in November
        compared to the same month of last year, which provided more room for the central bank to significantly slash
        its policy rate.<br /><br />

        "Stocks closed at a new all-time high, led by oil and energy sectors, amid upbeat data of petroleum sales, which
        surged 15% year-on-year (YoY), while cement sales increased 5.6% YoY in November," Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan
        Mehanti observed.<br /><br />

        "Imminent SBP policy rate cut, rupee stability and upbeat economic indicators for exports, trade deficit and the
        external account played the role of catalysts in record close at the PSX," he added.<br /><br />

        At the end of trading, the benchmark KSE-100 index posted a gain of 545.26 points, or 0.52%, to 105,104.34.<br /><br />

        Topline Securities, in its review, wrote that the KSE-100 index closed at an all-time high as the market
        maintained its bullish momentum and reached the intra-day high of 105,474 points.<br /><br />

        Persistent buying by local institutions, coupled with high trading volumes, reflected strong investor
        confidence, fuelled by expectations of a reduction in interest rate in the upcoming monetary policy meeting, it
        said.<br /><br />

        Major contributors to the index gains were Mari Petroleum, Hub Power, Airlink Communication, Millat Tractors and
        Pakistan State Oil, which collectively added 442 points.<br /><br />

        Arif Habib Limited (AHL) commented that the PSX closed trading above the 105,000 mark in a choppy session.<br /><br />

        Despite volatility, 54 shares rose while 44 fell. Mari Petroleum (+5.05%), Hub Power (+3.55%) and Airlink
        Communication (+8.65%) were the biggest contributors to the index gains, it mentioned.<br /><br />

        On the other hand, Habib Bank Limited (-2.51%), MCB Bank (-1.07%) and Service Industries (-3.47%) were the
        largest drags.<br /><br />

        Notable moves were seen in Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited (+10%), Pakistan Aluminium Beverage Cans
        (+9.64%) and BF Biosciences (+7.82%).<br /><br />

        The market continues to look higher, finding support at the 100,000 level, AHL added.<br /><br />

        JS Global analyst Mubashir Anis Naviwala remarked that the KSE-100 surged to 105,104, gaining 0.5% day-on-day,
        driven by encouraging economic indicators such as the narrowing trade deficit and expectations of a policy rate
        reduction amid easing inflation.<br /><br />

        Most actively traded stocks of the day were WorldCall Telecom, Cnergyico PK, Pakistan International Bulk
        Terminal and Pak Elektron.<br /><br />

        Key sectors, particularly energy and petroleum, showed a strong performance. Traded value, which reached an
        impressive Rs50 billion, reflected substantial market engagement, reinforcing the bullish momentum, Naviwala
        said.<br /><br />

        Overall trading volumes slightly decreased to 1.75 billion shares compared to Tuesday's tally of 1.77 billion.
        The value of shares traded during the day was Rs50.4 billion.<br /><br />

        Shares of 467 companies were traded. Of these, 258 stocks closed higher, 180 fell and 29 remained unchanged.<br /><br />

        WorldCall Telecom was the volume leader with trading in 257.5 million shares, gaining Rs0.14 to close at Rs1.61.
        It was followed by Cnergyico PK with trading in 213.2 million shares, gaining Rs0.13 to close at Rs6.85 and
        Pakistan International Bulk Terminal with 89.7 million shares, gaining Rs0.41 to close at Rs8.57.<br /><br />

        During the day, foreign investors sold shares worth Rs627.6 million, according to the NCCPL.<br /><br />
