    <p>At least 79 people have died from an unknown disease that is causing flu-like symptoms in south-western Democratic
    Republic of Congo, the health ministry says.<br /><br />

    The health ministry says the majority of people who have died are between the ages of 15 and 18.<br /><br />

    More than 300 people have been infected with patients exhibiting symptoms like fever, headaches, runny noses and
    coughs, breathing difficulties and anaemia.<br /><br />

    Response teams have been sent to Kwango Province, specifically the Panzi health zone, where the disease is most
    common, to manage cases and investigate the nature of the disease.<br /><br />

    Cephorien Manzanza, a civil society leader, told Reuters news agency the situation was worrying as the number of
    infected people continues to rise.<br /><br />

    "Panzi is a rural health zone, so there is a problem with the supply of medicines," he said.<br /><br />

    A World Health Organisation (WHO) Africa region official told the BBC they have "dispatched a team to the remote
    area to collect samples for lab investigations".<br /><br />

    Authorities have urged the population to remain calm and vigilant.<br /><br />

    They urged people to wash their hands with soap, avoid mass gatherings, and avoid touching the bodies of the
    deceased without qualified health personnel.<br /><br />

    A local MP told Top Congo Radio that about 67 people had fallen sick and died between 10 and 26 November.<br /><br />

    "It should be noted that Panzi hospital is short of medicines to cope with this epidemic. We really need
    assistance," said the MP.<br /><br />

    The central African country has also been dealing with a severe outbreak of mpox. Between January and July this
    year, they recorded about 14,500 infections.<br /><br />

    DR Congo has also dealt with bouts of Ebola over the years.<br /><br />
