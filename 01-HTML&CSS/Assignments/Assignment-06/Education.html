        In May, the Awami Joint Action Committee announced to end ongoing protests in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK)
        against soaring inflation a day after the government accepted their demands.<br /><br />

        It is pertinent to mention here that Azad Jammu and Kashmir witnessed violent clashes between the police and
        activists of a rights movement amid a wheel-jam and shutter-down strike across the territory, which left at
        least three people dead and several others injured.<br /><br />

        At least a man was killed and two others were injured as clashes between the protestors and law enforcement
        agencies once again erupted in Muzaffarabad on Monday.<br /><br />
